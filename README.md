Introduction
------------

This repository contains the source code for building a TikTok-like app using Swift and the IMG.LY CreativeEditor SDK. The app allows users to record videos, apply various edits such as filters, stickers, and audio, and then export the finished product. The CreativeEditor SDK simplifies the process of adding advanced video editing features to your app, allowing for rapid development of feature-rich applications.

Features
--------

*   **Video Recording**: Capture video clips directly within the app.
    
*   **Video Editing**: Apply filters, add stickers, text, and audio to your videos.
    
*   **Playback**: Play back the edited videos within the app.
    
*   **Exporting**: Export the final video to a standard video file format.
    

Requirements
------------

*   Xcode 12.0 or later
    
*   iOS 13.0 or later
    
*   Swift 5.3 or later
    
*   IMG.LY CreativeEditor SDK license (for both Camera and VideoEditor SDKs)
    

Installation
------------

1.  bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiktok-clone-ios.gitcd tiktok-clone-ios
    
2.  Install the required dependencies using Swift Package Manager:
    
    *   Open the project in Xcode.
        
    *   Navigate to File > Add Packages....
        
    *   arduinoCopy codehttps://github.com/imgly/IMGLYUI-swift
        
    *   Select the IMGLYUI package which includes all necessary submodules like IMGLYCamera, IMGLYVideoEditor, etc.
        
3.  Ensure that you have properly set up the necessary permissions in your app's Info.plist file to access the camera, microphone, and photo library.
    

Usage
-----

### Setting Up the Project

To start working on the TikTok clone:

1.  **Project Setup**: After cloning the repository, open the project in Xcode and ensure that the IMG.LY CreativeEditor SDK is integrated as per the instructions above.
    
2.  xmlCopy codeNSCameraUsageDescriptionLets you record videosNSMicrophoneUsageDescriptionLets you record audio with your videos
    
3.  **Run the App**: Build and run the project on a physical device to test the video recording and editing features.
    

### Building Your TikTok Clone

The TikTok clone involves the following key components:

*   **Video Recording**: Using IMGLYCamera, you can capture video clips directly within the app.
    
*   **Video Editing**: The IMGLYVideoEditor provides a range of editing tools, including adding filters, stickers, and audio. You can customize the appearance and behavior of these tools according to your app's requirements.
    
*   **Playback Controller**: The app uses Apple's AVPlayer for video playback, with customizations to support swiping through videos and looping playback.

Further Customization
---------------------

The IMG.LY CreativeEditor SDK allows extensive customization:

*   **Assets**: Customize the assets used in the editor (stickers, filters, etc.) by loading them from a local bundle or a remote server.
    
*   **UI Customization**: Modify the colors, icons, and layout of the editor to match your app's design language.
    
*   **Advanced Features**: Integrate more complex workflows by leveraging the underlying CreativeEngine APIs.
